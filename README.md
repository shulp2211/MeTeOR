## Project Description

This project is built off of python 3 for the creation of the MeTeOR network and MATLAB for the assessment of the network as well as the unsupervised link prediction.


## Raw Data and Results
To host the data and results of the project, I used [dat](https://datproject.org/) and [bulk downloads](http://meteor.lichtargelab.org/download).
### Installing Node and dat
To download data using dat, ensure node is installed and the version is higher than 4
```
node -v
```
If it needs to be installed got to their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
To install dat:
```bash
npm install -g dat
```
### Downloading the data
Navigate to the directory you wish to download, either data or results, and use:
```bash

```
