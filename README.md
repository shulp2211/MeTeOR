# Raw Data and Results

To host the data and results of the project, I used [dat](https://datproject.org/) and [bulk downloads](http://meteor.lichtargelab.org/download).

To download data using dat, ensure node is installed and the version is higher than 4
If it needs to be installed got to their 
 install dat:
```bash
npm install -g dat
```
navigate to the directory you wish to download, either data or results, and use:
```bash
dat clone ./
```
